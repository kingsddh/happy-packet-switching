				     Let's talk dreams.
				     
				     Specifically about our
				     'consensual hallucination
				     experienced daily by billions of
				     legitimate operators, in every
				     nation' having became
				     insufferable. A
				     trap. @therealdonaldtrump. Nightmare.

				     The nostalgia for what Snowden
				     calls 'The most pleasant and
				     successful anarchy Iâ€™ve ever
				     seen'. Late night dial up modem
				     phone bills, bulletin boards, ICQ
				     and AIM, 'internet art',
				     hypertextual voyages for the
				     psyche, piracy
				     universally. 

				     250 free hours? 700 free hours?! 1000 free hours!!
				     
				     Betrayal.

				     Perhaps to some of the inventors
				     of the ARPANET the dream was
				     originally - is essentially -
				     nothing beyond such ideals as
				     resource sharing, multiplexing.

				     But it would not be for the loss
				     of these that so many would
				     lament. With machines as with
				     books, to hell with authorial
				     dictatorships of meaning.
				     
				     And even ARPANET engineer Leonard
				     Kleinrock himself today broods,
				     'How did we get from there to
				     here?', when the there of the
				     internet's instansiation was
				     guided by the watchwords:
				     'ethical, open, trusted, free,
				     shared.'

				     But beyond liberal buzzwords.

				     A 'man-computer symbiosis', so
				     envisaged the internet's foremost
				     visionary JCR Licklider in
				     1960.

				     Often forgotten is that Lick's
				     concept had a twin, born of the
				     same situation and year -
				     'cyborg': the artificially
				     extended organism. Extended
				     specifically in terms of its
				     homeostasic capabilities, its
				     capacity to adapt itself and be
				     at liberty in an otherwise
				     hostile environment. Resilience.

				     Lick's man-computer cyborg was to
				     navigate data deluge. Lick's
				     promise: extend the human mind
				     through interactive, graphical
				     and internetworked computers and
				     reap information from big data
				     instead of entropy.

				     ARPA's funding of Lick's vision
				     culminated in the ARPANET.

				     Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline
				     coined the neologism 'cyborg'
				     while developing spacesuits:
				     mechanisms to artificial regulate
				     and thereby extend the domain of
				     the human organism into space.

				     1968: so many dreams - and
				     terrors - but also: the moon
				     landing.

				     Also Licklider and Bob Taylor's
				     announcement that `the move is on
				     to interconnect the separate
				     communities and thereby transform
				     them into, let us call it, a
				     supercommunity.'

				     Also the first issue of a
				     publication whose culture would
				     fundamentally orient the
				     technical milieus of late
				     capitalism, as Fred Turner charts

				     Leading up to the ARPANET, the
				     transcendent image of the whole
				     earth and not the distinct nation
				     came into view.

				    Buckminster Fuller with signature
				    geodesic dome or 'Bucky Ball'.

				    Stewart Brand, founder of whole
				    earth catalog, recalls being 'in
				    the thrall of [Fuller's thesis]:
				    it's no use trying to change human
				    nature. Don't bother with
				    politics. Go after the tools. New
				    tools make new practices. Better
				    tools make better practices.'

				    In Fuller, hippiedom discovered
				    the 'tool view of the world', adds
				    Kevin Kelly, a Whole Earth editor
				    who would with Brand start the
				    first online community, The Whole
				    Earth 'Lectronic Link (The WELL)
				    in 1983, and then in 1992 found
				    Wired magazine. 

				    That 'Tools are more powerful than
				    politics morphed into code is more
				    important than law.'

				<!--

				    This movement would immediately
				    anticipate the 1990s dream of a
				    'global social space' and 'new
				    home of the Mind' enabled not
				    through law but a global
				    cybernetic communication network.

				    But not because of the ARPANET,
				    which would barely be known till
				    1972.

				    Rather, it was the release of the
				    Sony Portapak, the first portable
				    video camera.

				    Just as every fact is also
				    metaphysical, every piece of
				    hardware implies software:
				    'information about its existence.
				    Television is the software of the
				    earth.'

				    Radical Software was home to these
				    visions of a decentralised,
				    informative, non-commercial,
				    global communications network that
				    today seems shattered.

				     1970: Marshal McLuhan, a pillar
				     of Whole Earth thought like
				     Fuller, writes that WWIII would
				     neither be centralised nor
				     decentralised, but 'a *guerrilla
				     information war* with no division
				     between military and civilian
				     participation.' Full matrix.
				     
				     He buys his student Paul Ryan a
				     Portapak and in Radical Software
				     that student declares the
				     portable video camera an
				     'experiment [which] carries
				     within it the logic of cybernetic
				     guerilla warfare.'
