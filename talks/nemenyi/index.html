				     Let's talk dreams.
				     
				     Specifically about our
				     'consensual hallucination
				     experienced daily by billions of
				     legitimate operators, in every
				     nation' having became
				     insufferable. A
				     trap. @therealdonaldtrump. Nightmare.

				     The nostalgia for what Snowden
				     calls 'The most pleasant and
				     successful anarchy Iâ€™ve ever
				     seen'. Late night dial up modem
				     phone bills, bulletin boards,
				     ICQ, 'internet art', hypertextual
				     voyages, piracy universally.
				     
				     The 1990s.

				     Betrayal.

				     I wish to suggest that though
				     this dream has always been
				     conceived as cybernetic, it was
				     not 'digital' in its
				     origin. That, the term 'digital'
				     occludes things.

				     Perhaps to some of the inventors
				     of the ARPANET the dream was
				     originally - is essentially -
				     nothing beyond such ideals as
				     resource sharing, multiplexing.

				     But it would not be for the loss
				     of these that so many would
				     lament. 

				     With machines as with books, to
				     hell with authorial dictatorships

				     And even ARPANET engineer Leonard
				     Kleinrock himself today broods,
				     'How did we get from there to
				     here?', when the there of the

				     1960: the internet's foremost
				     visionary JCR Licklider envisaged
				     a 'man-computer symbiosis'

				     Let's not forget it had a twin,
				     born of the same situation and
				     year - 'cyborg': an artificially
				     extended organism.

				     Extended specifically in terms of
				     homeostasic capabilities, the
				     capacity to adapt and live free
				     in an otherwise hostile
				     environment. 
				     
				     Data deluge. Lick says: extend
				     the mind with internetworked
				     computers and reap information
				     from big data instead of entropy.

				     The Library of the Future.

				     ARPA's funding of Lick's vision
				     culminated in ARPANET.

				     Clynes and Kline coined 'cyborg'
				     in 1960 developing spacesuits:
				     tools to artificial regulate the
				     human organism in space.

				     1968: so many dreams and terrors
				     but also: the moon landing.

				     Also Licklider and Bob Taylor's
				     announcement that `the move is on
				     to interconnect the separate
				     communities and thereby transform
				     them into, let us call it, a
				     supercommunity.'

				     Also the first issue of a
				     publication whose culture would
				     fundamentally orient the
				     technical milieus of late
				     capitalism.

				     Leading up to the ARPANET, the
				     transcendent image of the whole
				     earth and not the distinct nation
				     came into view.

				    But not because of the ARPANET,

				    Rather, it was the release of the
				    Sony Portapak, the first portable

				     As Fred Turner charts, the New

				     Not only did it permeate Neo

				     The intelligent swarm is the
				     beneficent hidden hand of
				     capitalism renewed.

				     But it also deeply penetrated the
				     dreams of the Left. Most notably,
				     Hardt and Negri's Empire series,
				     where the swarming network of
				     networks, the multitude, is
				     ontologically constituted against

				     I'm thinking of Donna Haraway's
				     Cyborg Manifesto.

				     Haraway poses that there is
				     nothing today but life
				     constituted through machines. The
				     machine of power in its
				     techno-scientific-governmental-militaristic
				     instantiation.

				     If post-War power is premised on

				     It undermines any prospect of an
				     objective, universal noosphere or
				     society of the mind. 

				     Instead: polyvocallity, partial
				     explanations, the preemption of
				     intersectionality.

				     In her followup essay Haraway
				     takes aim at this Time Life
				     anniversary cover, a supposedly
				     objective earth. Basically the
				     same image as the founding one of
				     the Whole Earth Catalog.

				     She writes, this 'infinite vision
				     is an illusion, a god-trick.'
				     This vision of the noosphere,
				     videosphere, cyberspace, a home
				     of mind.

				     Feminist vision should emphasise
				     the embodiment of vision,
				     embodied eyes, where they come
				     from and where they stand in
				     relation to power.

				     Do they see from subjugated or
				     subjugating - that is to say
				     'objective' - situations?
				     
				     With this Haraway preempts the
				     shattering of the dream of a
				     global cybernetic network.

				     Instead she poses: our reality is
				     constituted through cybernetic
				     power discrepencies, and our
				     dreams should lie not in
				     imagining we can transcending
				     them, but in their actual
