## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository, 
   ```shell
   git clone git@gitlab.com:kingsddh/happy-packet-switching.git
   ```
2. Talks are stored in the /talks/ directory. To add a new talk,
   create a new directory for each speaker. This is where we'll keep
   their html and images.
   ```shell
   cd talks
   mkdir licklider
   cp nemenyi/index.html licklider/
   ```
3. Edit the .slides div. Every `<section>` creates a new slide. Ensure
   that images have the class stretch, so that they go full screen. It
   might look something like this.
   
   ```html
	   <div class="slides">
		   <section>
			   <h1>Dr Daniel Nemenyi</h1>
			   <h3>Cybernetic Guerilla Warfare</h3>
		   </section>
		   <section><img class="stretch" src="01.png"></section>
		   <section><img class="stretch" src="02.png"></section>
		   <section><img class="stretch" src="03.png"></section>
		</div>
   ```
   
4. Link the speaker's `index.html` name to the root `index.html`.

5. Push changes to gitlab.
   
   ```shell
   git push
   ```
   Bear in mind it can take a few minutes for Gitlab Pages to update.
